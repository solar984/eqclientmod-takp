To use this, either adjust the paths at the top of Program.c or just put the files in c:\uifiles to do the scaling.
The default-pristine directory is just the original default directory, defaultx2 is the output.
After running the program it will populate the defaultx2 directory with the new tga and xml files.
Copy the contents of defaultx2-customized over top of the files there.

You can use this with other UIs, I've tried vert and poweroftwo, but you will have to customize a few things that the program doesn't scale properly.
